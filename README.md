# frames-bot
Python script for bots posting frames from movies on Facebook.

### How to use:
1. Paste your movie and the subtitle in 'extract-frames' folder.
2. Run embed-sub.sh. (if on Windows download git CMD from https://git-scm.com/download/win and run the script on that.)
3. Install requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Paste your Facebook authentication token in the stuff.py file (get yours from maxbots.ddns.net/tokens) (thank u Paintmin).
5. Run script.py.
